This is a simple and easy-to-use connection template for [Baileys](https://github.com/adiwajshing/Baileys), a powerful and feature-rich Node.js library for interacting with WhatsApp Web. Use this template to quickly set up a connection to WhatsApp Web using Baileys and start building your own customized WhatsApp bot or automation.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine.
- A WhatsApp account that you can use for testing (Baileys will be used to connect to your WhatsApp account).
- Basic understanding of JavaScript and Node.js.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the connection template:

1. Clone this repository or download the template as a ZIP file.

2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project folder.

3. Install the required dependencies using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

4. Rename the `config.example.js` file to `config.js`.

5. Open the `config.js` file and update the `sessionName` with a unique name for your session. You can also update other configuration options if needed.

6. Run the template:

```bash
node index.js
```

7. Scan the QR code using your WhatsApp account (you'll need to scan the QR code every time the session restarts).

8. You're all set! The template provides a basic setup for connecting to WhatsApp Web using Baileys. You can now start building your own custom features, commands, and automations.

## Customization

The `index.js` file provides a basic structure to get you started. You can customize and extend this template to create your own WhatsApp bot with features like message handling, sending media, replying to messages, and more. Baileys documentation is a great resource to explore the various features and capabilities the library offers.
